# Miako App MVP

**Mirai Aiko** (shortened to **Miako** for the domain and branding) – MVP demo of the AI assistant app. Private build for early testing with core features only.

## Previous Work & Learning Journey
This project builds upon my experimental work in [previous-repo-name], where I explored:
- CrewAI flow patterns
- LlamaIndex integration techniques  
- Context engineering approaches

That repository contains valuable learning experiments, though this MVP represents a more refined architecture based on those learnings.
