# Miako App MVP

**Mirai Aiko** (shortened to **Miako** for the domain and branding) – MVP demo of the AI assistant app. Private build for early testing with core features only.


## Evolution of This Project
This MVP evolved from earlier experimental work where I explored various AI frameworks. The journey from those initial experiments to this refined architecture taught me valuable lessons about:
- Context engineering for conversational AI
- Flow orchestration patterns
- LlamaIndex integration techniques  
- Production-ready code structure

[Experimental-RAG-Chatbot](https://github.com/NanaMein/Experimental-RAG-Chatbot) - contains learning experiments that informed this architecture
